# Daisy Mae

## Animal Crossing New Horizons Turnip Discord Bot

**Daisy Mae** is a discord bot specifically for Animal Crossing New Horizons made with [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). The goal is to make turnip trading
and notifications for a discord server eaiser! (It's also a good way for me to practice Go ;) )

**NOTE:** I am not planning on making Daisy Mae into a moderation bot as there are a lot of good ones existing
at the moment! Thanks!

I will not be providing a server for this bot. If you would like to use Daisy Mae, please check out the documentation
below.
